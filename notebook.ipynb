In the double-helix structure of DNA, each base is paired with another base that such that they are complementary paired. So, thymine (T) pairs with adenine (A) and cytosine (C) pairs with guanine (G). This is because the chemical structure and shape of thymine and adenine can form strong chemical bonds, and likewise between cytosine and guanine, which is necessary to maintain the double helix shape of DNA.\n",
